# Optimizing-Food-Security: Data Mining for Food Waste Reduction

Food wastage in retail outlets represents a significant challenge, not only contributing to revenue loss but also impacting global food security and sustainability efforts. Organizations like Oxfam, which are dedicated to alleviating poverty and hunger, face operational inefficiencies that hinder their ability to reduce waste effectively. These inefficiencies arise from factors such as poor inventory management, mismatched supply and demand, and suboptimal product placement strategies. This project seeks to analyze these factors, providing actionable insights to reduce wastage, improve resource allocation, and support Oxfam's mission of creating a sustainable and equitable food distribution system. 

## Objectives;
- Analyze Wastage and Revenue Loss: Identify product types and outlet characteristics that contribute to high levels of food wastage and revenue loss.
- Support Oxfam’s Mission: Provide insights to enhance food distribution strategies, aligning with Oxfam’s goals of reducing hunger and promoting sustainable practices.
- Predict and Forecast Trends: Use data mining techniques to predict the likelihood of product wastage and forecast future trends to guide strategic planning.
- Optimize Inventory Management: Highlight optimization opportunities for inventory and product placement to reduce wastage.
- Enhance Operational Efficiency: Identify underperforming outlets and inefficient processes to implement targeted improvements.
- By achieving these objectives, this project not only addresses the pressing issue of food wastage but also empowers Oxfam to refine its operations, contributing to its overarching goal of fostering sustainable food systems.

## Overview of the Dataset Chosen;
The dataset focuses on identifying patterns and factors contributing to food wastage in retail outlets and its relationship to revenue loss. It contains 5681 records with 11 attributes, sourced from the Kaggle dataset "Big Mart Sales" (URL: Big Mart Sales Dataset). Key attributes include:
- ProductID: Unique identifier for each product.
- Weight: Indicates product quantity, influencing perishability.
- FatContent: Classifies products by fat content (e.g., Low Fat, Regular).
- ProductVisibility: Shelf visibility, a critical factor in sales and wastage.
- ProductType: Category of the product (e.g., Dairy, Snacks, Beverages).
- MRP: Maximum Retail Price, reflecting the economic value of wasted products.
- OutletID: Unique identifier for each retail outlet.
- EstablishmentYear: The year the outlet was established, influencing operational efficiency.
- OutletSize: Outlet capacity, which correlates with inventory levels and wastage.
- LocationType: Geographical classification of the outlet's location.

This dataset is particularly relevant as it provides a comprehensive view of outlet and product characteristics, allowing for an in-depth analysis of food wastage patterns.

## Our Focus;
In this study, we focused on predicting the type of food in order to estimate the potential content of food waste. The prediction of food types serves a crucial role in determining the composition of food waste, which can subsequently be utilized for fertilizer preparation. This approach offers a valuable solution to reduce waste and promote sustainable practices by recycling food waste into useful resources. By accurately predicting the food types, we can better understand waste patterns and optimize processes for creating fertilizers, thus contributing to environmental sustainability.
